# Avocados_Price_Prediction

In this I have predicted the prices of Avocado and this is Regression problem  and this fruit is heavily consumed on United States.

I have loaded the dataset and checked the missing values and  there is no missing values.

This data is having both numerical and categorical data in dataset and handled using encoded techniques.

Outlier/Skewness is checked and treated.

Split the x and y variable and scaled the x variable.

train test split performed and trained model in different models.

I have used 1) KNeighbors 
2) Decision Tree
3) Ada Boost
4) Linear Regression

Applied cross validation score to check over fitting and under fitting

After knowing the best model ,Applied hyperparameter tuning to increse the accuracy the model.


Finally Saved the model.
